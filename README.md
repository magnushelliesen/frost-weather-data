# frost-weather-data
Just some fun in a [notebook](https://github.com/magnushelliesen/frost-weather-data/blob/main/frost-weather-data.ipynb) with daily weather data from Meterologisk institutt's Frost API. ARIMA models and forecasts may or may not make sense, and should not be used to decide on what to wear many days ahead.
To run the file you need [credentials](https://frost.met.no/auth/requestCredentials.html) to be put in toml-file.
